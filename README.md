## Description

In this article we will learn how to store secret or any other type of information you wish like Certificates in [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) .

Vault works by exchanging **information** for **secrets**, for example  a client could havea RoleID and a SecretID or a temporary Token that it can trade for the actual Secret.

It also can create temporary access to a 3rd party services like AWS through the use of back ends.

## Why do we want to use it.

* Centralized secrets storage and role based access.

* Replace secrets stored in source code or shell scripts which then are stored in places, difficult to replace with one time or temporary authentication credentials.

* Create dynamic authentication for short lived jobs, ie AWS infrastructure creation. This means that a short lived set of AWS secret/key pair is created for a job and they won't need to be hard coded.

* Optional, Human authentication to services like SSH, Jenkins, VPN, etc.

## The setup

We will test this by using a docker-compose project that will orchestrate 3 containers:

* Consul: service discovery and backend for storing encrypted secrets
* Vault: Service for converting tokens to secrets
* Jenkins: Automation

We persist Jenkins configuration in a Docker volume called "jenkins-data" and bind the local directory config to the Consul container so we can copy configuration later.

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
 consul:
   image: "consul"
   hostname: "consul"
   command: "agent -dev -client 0.0.0.0"
   ports:
     - "8400:8400"
     - "8500:8500"
     - "8600:53/udp"
 vault:
   depends_on:
     - consul
   image: "vault"
   hostname: "vault"
   links:
     - "consul:consul"
   environment:
     VAULT_ADDR: http://127.0.0.1:8200
   ports:
     - "8200:8200"
   volumes:

     - ./config/vault:/config
     - ./config/vault/policies:/policies
   entrypoint: /wait-for-it.sh -t 20 -h consul -p 8500 -s -- vault server -config=/config/with-consul.hcl
 blueocean:
   depends_on:
     - vault
   image: "jenkinsci/blueocean:latest"
   ports:
     - "8080:8080"
   volumes:

# Initial Vault configuration

The first command starts the container and the second one logs us in the Vault container to "unseal" it.

This is the term used by Vault to say the service is ready to be used and to do so we need 3 of the 5 keys that were generated by the init command.

This is only needed the first time we setup vault and you should store the keys in a secure place.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating vault_jenkins_consul_1 ... 
Creating vault_jenkins_consul_1 ... done
Creating vault_jenkins_vault_1 ... 
Creating vault_jenkins_vault_1 ... done
Creating vault_jenkins_blueocean_1 ... 
Creating vault_jenkins_blueocean_1 ... done

$ docker exec -it vault_jenkins_vault_1 sh

(vault_jenkins_vault_1)$ vault operator init
Unseal Key 1: Tx4UxHXmsx9S+6Q5hyLgVsM6ellMnoBiQejak05jJkyh
Unseal Key 2: VMU/j5/nX0iAvhKF2FXi2gpKjbu574MVoj4/ou1v7eqi
Unseal Key 3: LKDNywhJX+eF3f/xPCFLRkzWoizfpSf0fT85CJB9IKpk
Unseal Key 4: ypH0PS8p07iQ5ADi24Cu7LWJh7oZrZnBmuXt+Th84TS8
Unseal Key 5: OqjbC2h8+6iQ0IllDmPXK/oOMMlLVbxDC81RJpqDRZMG

Initial Root Token: s.HmQv84486IqbwY6fJYmYnWW0

(vault_jenkins_vault_1)$ vault operator unseal (run this 3 times with 3 different keys from above)

/ # vault operator unseal Tx4UxHXmsx9S+6Q5hyLgVsM6ellMnoBiQejak05jJkyh
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        true

```
```
Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 3 key to
reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.
```

## Checking Vault is unsealed

If the unseal was successful then you can login to the UI by going to:

[http://localhost:8500/ui/#/dc1/services/vault](http://localhost:8500/ui/#/dc1/services/vault)

![image alt text](image_0.png)

## Testing

The first command sets an alias so we dont have to keep typing the same thing over and over.

We will use the Vault client from inside the container but you can use one installed in your local machine too.

```bash
$ alias vault='docker exec -it vaultjenkins_vault_1 vault "$@"'

$ vault login
(Enter the Initial Root Token when prompted)

https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/secrets-engines/

$ vault secrets enable -path=kv kv
$ vault write kv/hello target=world

$ vault read kv/hello
Key                 Value
---                 -----
refresh_interval    768h
target              world
```

Here we store a secret text "world" in the path "kv/hello" and check in the UI if it was recorded encrypted.

And another value value=behind-super-secret-password

# Reading secrets from Jenkins

## The simplest way to test from Jenkins is to do the following:

Add the following as Environment variables in Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure-System > Environment Variables
```
VAULT_ADDR=http://vault:8200
VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true
VAULT_TOKEN=s.HmQv84486IqbwY6fJYmYnWW0  (This can be root token or generated token for a policy)
```
Save the above and create a free style Jenkins job. 

In the "Shell" Execution at the "Build" stage, add a script as below:
```bash
secretpath=kv/hello
curl -s -o vault.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/0.9.1/vault_0.9.1_linux_amd64.zip ; yes | unzip vault.zip
./vault read $secretpath
secret=$(./vault read -field target $secretpath)
echo Password is $secret
```


## AppRole

AppRole is a secure introduction method to establish machine identity. 

In AppRole, in order for the application to get a token, it would need to login using a Role ID (which is **static**, and associated with a policy), and a Secret ID  (which is **dynamic**, one time use, and can only be requested by a previously authenticated user/system. In this case, we have two options:

* Store the Role IDs in Jenkins

* Store the Role ID in the Jenkinsfile of each project

## Generating Policies and Roles

Now Jenkins will need permissions to retrieve Secret IDs for our newly created role. Jenkins shouldnâ€™t be able to access the secret itself, list other Secret IDs, or even the Role ID.

In this case, tokens assigned to the **java-example** policy would have permission to read a secret on the **secret/hello** path.

```bash
$ echo 'path "auth/approle/role/java-example/secret-id" {
  capabilities = ["read","create","update"]
}' > ./config/vault/policies/jenkins_policy.hcl

$ vault policy-write jenkins ./config/vault/policies/jenkins_policy.hcl

```


Now we have to create a **Role **that will generate **tokens **associated with that **policy**, and retrieve the token:

```bash
$ echo 'path "secret/hello" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list"]
}' > ./config/vault/policies/java-example_policy.hcl
$ vault policy-write java-example ./config/vault/policies/java-example_policy.hcl

Policy 'java-example' written.
```
```bash
$ vault auth-enable approle
$ vault write auth/approle/role/java-example \
> secret_id_ttl=60m \
> token_ttl=60m \
> token_max_tll=120m \
> policies="java-example"
Success! Data written to: auth/approle/role/java-example

$ vault read auth/approle/role/java-example
Key                 Value
---                 -----
bind_secret_id      true
bound_cidr_list
period              0
policies            [default java-example]
secret_id_num_uses  0
secret_id_ttl       3600
token_max_ttl       0
token_num_uses      0
token_ttl           3600

```



## Generating Role ID

We generate a **Role ID** for our application that can be used in conjunction with the Jenkins **Token ID** to generate a **Secret ID** that will allow us to access the secret at the path "secret/hello" per our policy.

```bash
$ vault read auth/approle/role/java-example/role-id
Key    	Value
---    	-----
role_id	73ea4552-53da-6844-bab0-0d39d2dc06aa
```

## Generating Jenkins Token ID

Jenkins needs a long lived token but it needs to be eventually rotated.

```bash
$ vault token-create -policy=jenkins
Key            	Value
---            	-----
token          	c70b74af-0e46-40da-ae15-c09b95a636f9
token_accessor 	1c1ad1bf-1b56-e398-169a-7e14600a3cb3
token_duration 	768h0m0s
token_renewable	true
token_policies 	[default jenkins]
```

## Configuring Jenkins credentials to access Vault

This is the long lived Token ID we generated for Jenkins use.


![image alt text](image_4.png)

This is the Role ID for our example app and is restricted to "secret/hello" by our policy, it can also be hardcoded in the source code or job script.

![image alt text](image_3.png)

## Reading the secret

Letâ€™s write a secret that our application will consume:

    $ vault write secret/hello value="You've Successfully retrieved a secret from Hashicorp Vault"
    Success! Data written to: secret/hello

We are going to exchange **ROLE_ID **(belonging only to this particular job) and a temporary **SECRET_ID **(generated with the Jenkins token) for another **SECRET_ID**.

This second **SECRET_ID** has a policy attached that will only let us access the secrets at the path "secret/hello".

This way we can authenticate our jobs and assign them specific access to our secrets, without leaving any secrets in our our source code or shell scripts.


```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
stages {  
  stage('Integration Tests') {
      steps {
      sh 'curl -s -o vault.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/0.9.1/vault_0.9.1_linux_amd64.zip ; yes | unzip vault.zip '
        withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'JAVA_EXAMPLE_ROLE_ID', variable: 'ROLE_ID'),string(credentialsId: 'JENKINS_VAULT_TOKEN', variable: 'VAULT_TOKEN')]) {
        sh '''
  set +x
  export VAULT_ADDR=http://vault:8200
  export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=true
  export SECRET_ID=$(./vault write -field=secret_id -f auth/approle/role/java-example/secret-id)
  export JOB_VAULT_TOKEN=$(./vault write -field=token auth/approle/login role_id=${ROLE_ID}   secret_id=${SECRET_ID})
./vault read -address=http://vault:8200 secret/hello 
        '''
    }
   }
  }
 }
}
```



* We retrieve a **SECRET_ID **A using Jenkins administrative **JENKINS_VAULT_TOKEN **(that weâ€™ve manually generated before). Thatâ€™s the only one that would be relatively longed lived, but can only generate SECRET_IDs. Notice that we store this SECRET_ID A in the environment variable called VAULT_TOKEN so the vault client can use it.

    * ```
      ./vault write -field=secret_id -f auth/approle/role/java-example/secret-id
      ```

      â€‹

* We do an AppRole login with the **ROLE_ID **and the **SECRET_ID A **(short lived), this gives us a second **SECRET_ID B** that we store in the environment variable VAULT_TOKEN:

    * ```
      ./vault write -field=token auth/approle/login role_id=${ROLE_ID} secret_id=${SECRET_ID}
      ```

* We use this **SECRET_ID B** to read our plain text secret:

    * ```
      ./vault read -address=http://vault:8200 secret/hello 
      ```

      â€‹

## Retrieving secrets from source code

We can also retrieve the secrets from an application at run time, using environment variables to authenticate to Vault like this:

```java
<td>  String vaulttoken = System.getenv("VAULT_TOKEN");
    String vaulthost = System.getenv("VAULT_ADDR");
    System.out.format( "Using Vault Host %s\n", vaulthost);
    System.out.format( "With Vault Token %s\n", vaulttoken );
    /* This should be a separate method called from Main, then
     * again for simplicity...
     */
    final VaultConfig config = new VaultConfig().build();
    final Vault vault = new Vault(config);
    try {
    final String value = vault.logical()
                   .read("secret/hello")
                   .getData().get("value");
    System.out.format( "value key in secret/hello is " + value +"\n");
    } catch(VaultException e) {
      System.out.println("Exception thrown: " + e);
    }
```

# Optional: Installing Vault plugin for Jenkins

More information: [https://github.com/jenkinsci/hashicorp-vault-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/hashicorp-vault-plugin)

![image alt text](image_2.png)



If we decide to use this plugin then we will be using the "[Response Wrapping](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/response-wrapping.html)" feature from vault.

This feature creates one time use tokens that are used to access specific secrets and limiting the time they can be used.

```groovy
node {
  // define the secrets and the env variables
  def secrets = [
      [$class: 'VaultSecret', path: 'secret/testing', secretValues: [
          [$class: 'VaultSecretValue', envVar: 'testing', vaultKey: 'value_one'],
          [$class: 'VaultSecretValue', envVar: 'testing_again', vaultKey: 'value_two']]],
      [$class: 'VaultSecret', path: 'secret/another_test', secretValues: [
          [$class: 'VaultSecretValue', envVar: 'another_test', vaultKey: 'value']]]
  ]

  // optional configuration, if you do not provide this the next higher configuration
  // (e.g. folder or global) will be used
  def configuration = [$class: 'VaultConfiguration',
                       vaultUrl: 'http://my-very-other-vault-url.com',
                       vaultCredentialId: 'my-vault-cred-id']

  // inside this block your credentials will be available as env variables
  wrap([$class: 'VaultBuildWrapper', configuration: configuration, vaultSecrets: secrets]) {
      sh 'echo $testing'
      sh 'echo $testing_again'
      sh 'echo $another_test'
  }
}
```
